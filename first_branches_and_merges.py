#This is for group 2 and 3 to learn how to use github source control, branching and merging
#I have specific challenge for each person
'''Each person will:
*clone the repo
*make a branch named after themselves
*use several commits to show progress on branch
*test that your function works and print results
*add a file named after youself that you are proud to share
*make a pull request for it to be merged to main branch
'''
